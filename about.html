            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            
                <p> I am a Grade 11 student at Henry Wise Wood High School. 
                <br>I have various interests, including sports, gaming,
                <br> programming, and spending time with my loved ones. 
                <br>In terms of sports, I play tier 1 for Foothills FC and serve 
                <br> as the team's starting left-back. I also play on the Henry 
                <br> Wise Wood soccer team, where I was selected Co-captain 
                <br> and played central-defensive-midfielder, leading the team 
                <br> to the Calgary High School Sports Association playoff finals. 
                <br> I also enjoy programming, which is why I decided to pursue 
                <br>this project: to improve my skill set and work with something 
                <br>I'm passionate about. When I have spare time, I like to spend it 
                <br> my friends and family because they help me escape from the
                <br>demands of academics and regroup. I also like spending 
                <br> quality time with my dog Coco, a 5-year-old Bichon Shih Tzu. 
                <br>Finally, I like playing video games on my console. I frequently 
                <br> play multiplayer games with my friends, and time flies when I do! </p>
