            <h2>MY HOBBIES</h2>
            
                <p> As mentioned previously, I love to play soccer. I used to  
                <br> be a part of a great club team but unfortunately stopped 
                <br> playing club soccer to focus on school. Although, I am the co
                <br> captain of my school's soccer team and was the top scorer.
                <br> One of my favorite memories playing soccer was a 
                <br> tournament I attended with my club team. It was in Vancouver
                <br> and was a great team-bonding experience as everyone got 
                <br> closer with one another. We won gold that tournament and it was
                <br> definitely one of the best weekends of my life! Whenever I have
                <br> free time, I spend time playing on my  
                <br> console with my friend and family. With my family, we 
                <br> play games that are locally multiplayer such as simulator
                <br> sports game where we have fun competing against eachother.
                <br> With my friends, we play games that are multiplayer such as 
                <br> pvp or sports games. We play games such as Rocket League, 
                <br> Fortnite, and Fifa. Through gaming, I build stronger bonds
                <br> with my loved ones.
